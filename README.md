👋 Hi, I’m @adrianafaical
👀 I’m interested in advancing technologies and digital health to support people diagnosed with Rare Diseases (RD).
🌱 I’m currently learning about Design Thinking and approaches that can improve the journey of people with RD.
💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on developing projects that promote healthcare solutions, resource availability, and sharing of experiences.
